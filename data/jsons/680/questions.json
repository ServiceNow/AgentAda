        "cell_ids": [24, 32],
        "question": "How were the missing values identified before applying KNN imputation?",
        "answer": "The missing values were identified by calculating the percentage of missing data for each feature and visualizing the distribution.",

        "cell_ids": [44, 52, 60],
        "question": "Which features in the dataset had the highest percentage of missing values?",

        "cell_ids": [68, 76, 84],
        "question": "How did the dataset change after applying KNN imputation?",
        "answer": "The dataset was completed with estimated values for missing entries, preserving the overall feature distribution more effectively than simple imputation techniques.",

        "cell_ids": [92, 100, 108],
        "question": "How was the optimal value of k selected for KNN imputation?",
        "answer": "The optimal k value was determined by testing different values and selecting the one that minimized imputation error and maximized data consistency.",

    {
        "cell_ids": [116, 124, 132],
        "question": "What were the advantages of using KNN imputation over mean or median imputation?",
        "answer": "KNN imputation maintained the relationships between features, whereas mean or median imputation could introduce biases and distort data distributions.",

        "cell_ids": [140, 148, 156],
        "question": "How did KNN imputation impact the variance of numerical features?",
        "answer": "KNN imputation preserved variance better than simple imputation methods, as it estimated missing values based on feature similarity rather than fixed values.",

        "question": "What was the effect of KNN imputation on model performance compared to other imputation methods?",
        "answer": "Models trained on KNN-imputed data outperformed those trained on mean/median-imputed data, as KNN preserved feature dependencies better.",
        "task": "Data Imputation",
        "skill": "KNN Imputation"
    },
    {
        "cell_ids": [188, 196],
        "question": "What preprocessing steps were performed before applying KNN imputation?",
        "answer": "Features were standardized, categorical variables were encoded, and missing values were visualized to guide imputation strategy selection.",
