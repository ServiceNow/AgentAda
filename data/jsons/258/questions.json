      "cell_ids": [18, 19, 20],
      "question": "How do the behaviors of high-frequency high-monetary customers differ from those of low-frequency low-monetary customers?",
      "answer": "High-frequency high-monetary customers are consistent spenders with significant purchases, while low-frequency low-monetary customers show minimal engagement and low spending.",
