      "cell_ids": [18, 19, 20],
      "question": "How do the behaviors of high-frequency high-monetary customers differ from low-frequency low-monetary customers?",
      "answer": "High-frequency high-monetary customers exhibit regular purchases and significant spending, while low-frequency low-monetary customers are infrequent and contribute less revenue.",
