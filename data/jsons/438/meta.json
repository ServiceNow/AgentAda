    "dataset_description": "The Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB) is a novel benchmark for evaluating algorithms for anomaly detection in streaming, online applications. It is comprised of over 50 labeled real-world and artificial timeseries data files plus a novel scoring mechanism designed for real-time applications. All of the data and code is fully open-source, with extensive documentation, and a scoreboard of anomaly detection algorithms: github.com/numenta/NAB. The full dataset is included here, but please go to the repo for details on how to evaluate anomaly detection algorithms on NAB.",
