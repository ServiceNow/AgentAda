    "dataset_description": "Hierarchical clustering algorithms are either top-down or bottom-up. Bottomup algorithms treat each document as a singleton cluster at the outset and then successively merge (or agglomerate) pairs of clusters until all clusters have been merged into a single cluster that contains all documents. Bottom up hierarchical clustering is therefore called hierarchical agglomerative clustering or HAC. Top-down clustering requires a method for splitting a cluster. HAC It proceeds by splitting clusters recursively until individual documents are reached. ",
