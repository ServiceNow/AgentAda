      "question": "What is the total number of customers in the dataset, and how does this form the basis for segmentation analysis?",
      "answer": "The dataset contains 10,000 customers, providing a large sample size for robust segmentation analysis.",

    {
      "cell_ids": [2, 3],
      "question": "What is the distribution of recency values in the dataset, and how do they influence segmentation?",
      "answer": "Recency values range from 1 to 300 days, with lower values indicating more recent transactions.",

    {
      "cell_ids": [4, 6, 8],
      "question": "What is the frequency distribution of customer transactions, and what does this reveal about engagement levels?",
      "answer": "Transaction frequencies range from 1 to 200, with most customers having fewer than 15 transactions.",

      "cell_ids": [10, 12],
      "question": "What is the range of monetary values in the dataset, and what patterns can be observed among high-value customers?",
      "answer": "Monetary values range from $20 to $15,000, with high-value customers typically having high transaction frequency and recent activity.",

      "cell_ids": [14, 16],
      "question": "How many clusters were identified using K-means with RFM features, and what are the defining characteristics of each cluster?",
      "answer": "Five clusters were identified, characterized by varying levels of recency, frequency, and monetary values.",

    },
    {
      "cell_ids": [18, 20],
      "question": "What are the average RFM scores for each cluster, and how do they define customer behaviors?",
      "answer": "Clusters range from high-recency low-monetary customers to low-recency high-frequency high-monetary customers.",

      "skill": "RFM Analysis"
    },
    {
      "cell_ids": [22, 25],
      "question": "Which RFM feature has the greatest impact on cluster formation, and how does this influence the clustering results?",
      "answer": "Frequency and monetary values have the strongest influence, with recency playing a secondary role.",

    {
      "cell_ids": [32, 35],
      "question": "What actionable marketing strategies can be developed for each identified customer segment?",
      "answer": "Strategies include loyalty programs for high-monetary customers and re-engagement campaigns for high-recency low-frequency customers.",
      "task": "Customer Segmentation",
      "skill": "RFM Analysis"
    },
    {
      "cell_ids": [37, 40],
      "question": "How do the behaviors of high-frequency high-monetary customers differ from low-frequency low-monetary customers?",
      "answer": "High-frequency high-monetary customers are loyal and consistent spenders, while low-frequency low-monetary customers are infrequent and less engaged.",
