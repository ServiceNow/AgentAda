    "dataset_description": "Stock market data can be interesting to analyze and as a further incentive, strong predictive models can have large financial payoff. The amount of financial data on the web is seemingly endless. A large and well structured dataset on a wide array of companies can be hard to come by. Here provided a dataset with historical stock prices (last 12 years) for 29 of 30 DJIA companies (excluding 'V' because it does not have the whole 12 years data).",
