    {
      "cell_ids": [2, 3],
      "question": "What is the distribution of recency values in the dataset, and how do they affect customer segmentation?",
      "answer": "Recency values range from 1 to 365 days, with lower values indicating more recent interactions.",

      "cell_ids": [14, 16],
      "question": "How many clusters were identified using K-means with RFM features, and what are the defining characteristics of each cluster?",
      "answer": "Five clusters were identified, with variations in recency, frequency, and monetary values defining each group.",

    {
      "cell_ids": [18, 20],
      "question": "What are the average RFM scores for each cluster, and how do they represent different customer behaviors?",

    {
      "cell_ids": [22, 25],
      "question": "Which RFM feature has the greatest impact on cluster formation, and how does it influence customer segmentation?",
      "answer": "Frequency and monetary values are the most significant contributors to cluster formation, with recency as a secondary factor.",

      "cell_ids": [32, 35],
      "question": "What actionable strategies can be developed for each customer segment identified in the clustering analysis?",
      "answer": "Strategies include loyalty programs for high-frequency high-monetary customers and re-engagement campaigns for high-recency low-frequency customers.",
      "task": "Customer Segmentation",
      "skill": "K-means Clustering"
    },
    {
      "cell_ids": [37, 40],
      "question": "How do the characteristics of low-recency high-monetary customers differ from high-recency low-monetary customers?",
      "answer": "Low-recency high-monetary customers are consistent and loyal spenders, while high-recency low-monetary customers are newer and less engaged.",
