    "dataset_description": "For my Data Mining lab where we had to execute algorithms like apriori, it was very difficult to get a small data set with only a few transactions. It was infeasible to run the algorithm with datasets containing over 10000 transactions. This dataset contains 11 items : JAM, MAGGI, SUGAR, COFFEE, CHEESE, TEA, BOURNVITA, CORNFLAKES, BREAD, BISCUIT and MILK.",
