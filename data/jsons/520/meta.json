    "dataset_description": "The goal of this competition is to use seismic signals to predict the timing of laboratory earthquakes. The data comes from a well-known experimental set-up used to study earthquake physics. The acoustic_data input signal is used to predict the time remaining before the next laboratory earthquake (time_to_failure).",
