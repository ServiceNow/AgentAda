      "question": "What is the total number of customers in the dataset, and how does this provide a foundation for segmentation analysis?",
      "answer": "The dataset contains 8,500 customers, offering a substantial base for segmentation analysis.",

      "skill": "Basic Data Analysis"
    },
    {
      "cell_ids": [2, 3],
      "question": "What is the distribution of recency values in the dataset, and how do they influence segmentation?",
      "answer": "Recency values range from 1 to 365 days, with lower values indicating more recent customer activity.",

    {
      "cell_ids": [4, 6, 8],
      "question": "What is the frequency distribution of customer transactions, and what does it reveal about engagement levels?",
      "answer": "Transaction frequencies range from 1 to 100, with most customers falling below 15 transactions.",

      "cell_ids": [10, 12],
      "question": "What is the range of monetary values in the dataset, and what patterns emerge among high-value customers?",
      "answer": "Monetary values range from $50 to $20,000, with high-value customers showing high transaction frequency and low recency.",

    {
      "cell_ids": [14, 16],
      "question": "How many clusters were identified using K-means with RFM features, and what are the defining characteristics of each cluster?",
      "answer": "Four clusters were identified, characterized by varying levels of recency, frequency, and monetary values.",

      "skill": "RFM Analysis"
    },
    {
      "cell_ids": [18, 20],
      "question": "What are the average RFM scores for each cluster, and how do they represent different customer behaviors?",
      "answer": "Clusters range from high-recency low-monetary customers to low-recency high-frequency high-monetary customers.",
      "task": "Customer Segmentation",
      "skill": "RFM Analysis"
    },
    {
      "cell_ids": [22, 25],
      "question": "Which RFM feature contributes most to cluster formation, and how does this reflect customer behavior?",
      "answer": "Frequency and monetary values contribute the most to cluster formation, while recency provides additional differentiation.",

    {
      "cell_ids": [27, 30],
      "question": "What is the optimal number of clusters, and how was it determined using the elbow method?",
      "answer": "The optimal number of clusters was determined to be four based on the elbow method.",

    },
    {
      "cell_ids": [32, 35],
      "question": "What actionable marketing strategies can be developed for each customer segment based on the clustering results?",
      "answer": "Strategies include loyalty programs for high-frequency high-monetary customers and re-engagement offers for high-recency customers.",
      "task": "Customer Segmentation",
      "skill": "RFM Analysis"
    },
    {
      "cell_ids": [37, 40],
      "question": "How do the purchasing patterns of high-frequency high-monetary customers differ from those of low-frequency low-monetary customers?",
      "answer": "High-frequency high-monetary customers are consistent and valuable spenders, while low-frequency low-monetary customers are less engaged and contribute minimally.",
