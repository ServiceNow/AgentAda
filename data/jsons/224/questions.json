    {
      "cell_ids": [2, 3],
      "question": "What is the distribution of annual income among the customers, and how does this vary across different segments?",
      "answer": "Annual income ranges from $15,000 to $150,000, with the majority of customers earning between $50,000 and $100,000.",

      "cell_ids": [10, 12],
      "question": "How is the spending score distributed among customers, and what patterns can be identified among high and low spenders?",
      "answer": "Spending scores range from 1 to 100, with high spenders often being younger customers with mid-to-high incomes.",

    {
      "cell_ids": [14, 16],
      "question": "How many clusters were identified using K-means, and what key characteristics define each cluster?",
      "answer": "Five clusters were identified, characterized by varying levels of income, spending scores, and age demographics.",

    {
      "cell_ids": [18, 20],
      "question": "What is the average income and spending score for each cluster, and how do these define customer behavior?",
      "answer": "Clusters range from low-income low-spenders to high-income high-spenders, with distinct patterns in age and preferences.",

      "cell_ids": [22, 25],
      "question": "Which demographic features contribute most to cluster formation, and how are they reflected in the clustering results?",
