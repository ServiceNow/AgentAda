    {
      "cell_ids": [2, 3],
      "question": "What is the distribution of recency values among customers, and how do they vary across the dataset?",
      "answer": "Recency values range from 1 to 360 days, with lower values indicating more recent activity.",

      "cell_ids": [8, 9, 10],
      "question": "How many clusters were identified using hierarchical clustering, and what are the defining characteristics of each cluster?",
      "answer": "Five clusters were identified, characterized by distinct levels of recency, frequency, and monetary value.",

    {
      "cell_ids": [11, 12],
      "question": "What are the average recency, frequency, and monetary values for each cluster, and how do they define customer behaviors?",
      "answer": "Clusters range from low-recency high-frequency high-monetary customers to high-recency low-frequency low-monetary customers.",

    {
      "cell_ids": [13, 14, 15],
      "question": "Which feature, such as recency, frequency, or monetary value, contributed most significantly to cluster formation?",
      "answer": "Frequency and monetary values were the most significant contributors, while recency provided additional differentiation.",

    {
      "cell_ids": [16, 17],
      "question": "What actionable strategies can be developed for each identified customer segment based on the hierarchical clustering results?",
      "answer": "Strategies include loyalty rewards for high-value customers, reactivation campaigns for high-recency customers, and targeted promotions for mid-value segments.",

    {
      "cell_ids": [18, 19, 20],
      "question": "How do the spending and engagement behaviors of high-value clusters differ from those of low-value clusters?",
      "answer": "High-value clusters exhibit frequent and high-value purchases, while low-value clusters show infrequent and low-spending behaviors.",
