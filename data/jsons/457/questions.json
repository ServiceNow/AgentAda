        "cell_ids": [22, 30, 37],
        "question": "Which geographic regions have the highest and lowest median house prices?",
        "answer": "Coastal regions like San Francisco and Los Angeles have the highest median house prices, while inland and rural areas have the lowest.",

        "cell_ids": [45, 53, 62],
        "question": "How is spatial autocorrelation used in analyzing California housing prices?",
        "answer": "Spatial autocorrelation helps identify clusters of high or low housing prices based on geographic proximity.",

        "cell_ids": [70, 78, 86, 95],
        "question": "What does a high positive Moran’s I value indicate in the housing dataset?",
        "answer": "A high positive Moran’s I value indicates that similar housing prices are clustered together in geographic space.",

        "cell_ids": [103, 112, 121, 130],
        "question": "What is the significance of a Moran’s I value close to zero in this dataset?",
        "answer": "A Moran’s I value close to zero suggests a random spatial distribution of housing prices, meaning no significant clustering.",

        "question": "How does population density correlate with spatial autocorrelation in house prices?",
        "answer": "Higher population density areas tend to have stronger spatial autocorrelation in house prices due to market forces and demand.",

        "answer": "Median income, proximity to coastal areas, and population density contribute most to spatial autocorrelation in house prices.",

        "cell_ids": [208, 217, 226, 235],
        "question": "How does changing the spatial weight matrix affect Moran’s I results?",
        "answer": "Changing the spatial weight matrix affects the strength of detected spatial autocorrelation by redefining neighborhood relationships.",

        "cell_ids": [243, 252, 261, 270],
        "question": "What does a negative Moran’s I value indicate about housing price distribution?",
        "answer": "A negative Moran’s I value suggests dispersion, meaning high and low housing prices are interspersed rather than clustered.",
