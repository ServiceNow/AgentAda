    "dataset_description": "This competition uses nine different datasets, completely independent and not linked to each other. Each dataset can represent a different kind of waterbody. As each waterbody is different from the other, the related features as well are different from each other. So, if for instance we consider a water spring we notice that its features are different from the lakeâ€™s one. This is correct and reflects the behavior and characteristics of each waterbody. The Acea Group deals with four different type of waterbodies: water spring (for which three datasets are provided), lake (for which a dataset is provided), river (for which a dataset is provided) and aquifers (for which four datasets are provided).",
