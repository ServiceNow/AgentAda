        "cell_ids": [18, 26],
        "question": "How was the proportion of missing values determined for each feature?",
        "answer": "The proportion of missing values was calculated by dividing the number of missing entries by the total observations for each feature.",

        "cell_ids": [58, 66, 74],
        "question": "How does KNN imputation handle missing values compared to mean or median imputation?",
        "answer": "KNN imputation estimates missing values based on the k-nearest neighbors in the feature space, preserving relationships better than mean or median imputation.",

    {
        "cell_ids": [178, 186, 194],
        "question": "How did KNN imputation affect machine learning model performance?",
        "answer": "Models trained on KNN-imputed data showed improved performance compared to those using mean or median imputation, due to better feature retention.",
