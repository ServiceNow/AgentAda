      "cell_ids": [2, 3],
      "question": "What is the percentage of fraudulent transactions in the dataset, and how does this imbalance affect the anomaly detection process?",
      "answer": "The percentage of fraudulent transactions is 0.15%, highlighting the significant class imbalance that makes anomaly detection critical.",

      "cell_ids": [4, 6, 9],
      "question": "What is the average transaction amount in the dataset, and how does it compare to the typical transaction amounts flagged as anomalies?",
      "answer": "The average transaction amount is $140.00, while anomalies are frequently associated with higher transaction amounts.",

      "cell_ids": [20],
      "question": "What is the minimum transaction amount recorded in the dataset, and how common are transactions near this value?",
      "answer": "The minimum transaction amount is $1.00, and transactions near this value occur frequently, reflecting common low-value purchases.",

      "cell_ids": [22, 24, 26],
      "question": "Which features are identified as most significant for detecting anomalies, and what specific patterns in these features contribute to the identification of outliers?",
      "answer": "Significant features include 'Transaction Amount', 'Time of Transaction', and 'Merchant Type', where unusual combinations often indicate anomalies.",

    {
      "cell_ids": [27, 29],
      "question": "What are the typical characteristics of flagged anomalies in terms of transaction time and merchant type?",
      "answer": "Flagged anomalies often occur during non-business hours and involve unusual merchant types compared to normal transactions.",

      "cell_ids": [30, 33, 35],
      "question": "What is the distribution of transaction amounts among flagged anomalies, and how does this differ from the distribution in normal transactions?",
      "answer": "Flagged anomalies are concentrated in the top 10% of transaction amounts, while normal transactions show a broader, more uniform distribution.",

    {
      "cell_ids": [36, 39],
      "question": "What proportion of flagged anomalies corresponds to fraudulent transactions, and what does this indicate about the model's precision in identifying true fraud?",
      "answer": "Approximately 85% of flagged anomalies correspond to fraudulent transactions, indicating high precision in detecting true fraud cases.",

      "skill": "Isolation Forest"
    },
    {
      "cell_ids": [41, 44, 46, 49],
      "question": "What unique transaction patterns distinguish normal transactions from anomalies, and how can these patterns guide future fraud prevention measures?",
      "answer": "Normal transactions exhibit consistent values for 'Merchant Type' and 'Transaction Time', whereas anomalies often show unusual deviations. These patterns can inform stricter validation checks.",
