      "question": "What is the total number of transactions in the dataset, and how does this volume affect the detection of fraudulent transactions?",
      "answer": "The dataset contains 400,000 transactions, providing a sufficient sample size for identifying patterns in fraudulent activity.",

      "skill": "Basic Data Analysis"
    },
    {
      "cell_ids": [2, 4],
      "question": "What percentage of the transactions in the dataset are fraudulent, and what implications does this have for the model's sensitivity to class imbalance?",
      "answer": "Fraudulent transactions make up 0.25% of the dataset, emphasizing the importance of handling class imbalance effectively.",

      "cell_ids": [23, 26, 28],
      "question": "Which features are identified as most predictive of fraudulent activity, and how do these features contribute to the neural network's decision-making process?",
      "answer": "Key features include 'Transaction Amount', 'Merchant Category', and 'User Region', where anomalous patterns in these features strongly correlate with fraud.",

    {
      "cell_ids": [41, 43],
      "question": "What patterns in transaction frequency are associated with flagged fraudulent transactions?",
      "answer": "Accounts with unusually high transaction frequencies within short periods are commonly flagged as fraudulent.",
