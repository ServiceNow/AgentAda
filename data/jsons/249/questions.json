    {
      "cell_ids": [23, 24, 25, 26],
      "question": "How do the behaviors of high-frequency high-monetary customers differ from low-frequency low-monetary customers?",
      "answer": "High-frequency high-monetary customers are consistent and high-value contributors, while low-frequency low-monetary customers show minimal engagement.",
